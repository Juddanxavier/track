# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The lead management feature enables administrators to track potential customers for parcel shipping services. This system allows admins to capture lead information including origin/destination countries, weight, and track the lead status through the sales pipeline. Successful leads can later be converted to actual shipment tracking records. The feature leverages the existing data table infrastructure used for user management to maintain consistency and reduce development overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to add new leads to the system, so that I can track potential customers and their shipping requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the lead management interface THEN the system SHALL display an "Add Lead" button
2. WHEN an admin clicks "Add Lead" THEN the system SHALL open a form with fields for customer name, email, phone, origin country, destination country, weight, and notes
3. WHEN an admin submits a valid lead form THEN the system SHALL create a new lead with status "new" and display a success message
4. IF any required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent submission
5. WHEN a lead is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique lead ID and timestamp

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to assign customers to leads, so that I can link existing customers with their shipping inquiries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing a lead THEN the system SHALL provide a customer selection dropdown
2. WHEN an admin selects a customer THEN the system SHALL auto-populate customer name, email, and phone fields
3. WHEN no customer is selected THEN the system SHALL allow manual entry of customer details
4. IF a customer is assigned to a lead THEN the system SHALL store the customer relationship

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to track lead status through the sales pipeline, so that I can monitor progress and follow up appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing leads THEN the system SHALL display status options: "new", "contacted", "failed", "success"
2. WHEN an admin updates lead status THEN the system SHALL save the change with timestamp
3. WHEN lead status changes to "success" THEN the system SHALL enable conversion to shipment tracking
4. WHEN lead status is "failed" THEN the system SHALL allow adding failure reason notes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view and manage all leads in a data table, so that I can efficiently track and organize lead information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses lead management THEN the system SHALL display leads in a sortable, filterable data table
2. WHEN viewing the leads table THEN the system SHALL show columns for customer name, origin country, destination country, weight, status, and created date
3. WHEN an admin clicks on a lead row THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit, delete, or convert the lead
4. WHEN filtering leads THEN the system SHALL support filtering by status, country, and date range
5. WHEN searching leads THEN the system SHALL search across customer name, email, and countries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to edit existing lead information, so that I can update details as the lead progresses through the pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin selects "Edit" on a lead THEN the system SHALL open a form pre-populated with current lead data
2. WHEN an admin updates lead information THEN the system SHALL validate and save changes
3. WHEN editing a lead THEN the system SHALL allow updating all fields except the lead ID
4. WHEN lead changes are saved THEN the system SHALL update the modified timestamp

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to delete leads that are no longer relevant, so that I can maintain a clean lead database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin selects "Delete" on a lead THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the lead from the database
3. WHEN a lead is deleted THEN the system SHALL display a success message and refresh the lead list
4. IF a lead has status "success" THEN the system SHALL warn before allowing deletion

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to convert successful leads to shipment tracking, so that I can transition from sales to operations seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lead has status "success" THEN the system SHALL display a "Convert to Shipment" option
2. WHEN converting a lead THEN the system SHALL pre-populate shipment details from lead data
3. WHEN conversion is completed THEN the system SHALL create a shipment record and update lead status to "converted"
4. WHEN a lead is converted THEN the system SHALL maintain the relationship between lead and shipment for tracking purposes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want failed leads to be automatically deleted after 45 days and successful leads to be moved to an archive, so that the database remains clean and complies with data retention policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lead has status "failed" for 45 days THEN the system SHALL automatically delete the lead from the active database
2. WHEN a lead has status "success" for a configurable period THEN the system SHALL move the lead to an archived state
3. WHEN leads are archived THEN the system SHALL maintain a separate archive table or flag for historical tracking
4. WHEN the cleanup process runs THEN the system SHALL log all deletion and archival actions for audit purposes
5. WHEN archived leads are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide a separate interface to view archived leads
6. WHEN the automated cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL send notifications to administrators about the actions taken

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an admin, I want the lead management to integrate with existing user management infrastructure, so that development is efficient and the interface is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing lead management THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing DataTable component
2. WHEN displaying leads THEN the system SHALL follow the same UI patterns as user management
3. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL use similar API patterns as user management
4. WHEN validating lead data THEN the system SHALL use consistent validation patterns with user management
