# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a central notification system that serves both customer and admin users. The system will provide real-time notifications through a bell icon interface and a dedicated notifications page, enabling users to stay informed about important events, updates, and system activities relevant to their role and context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user (customer or admin), I want to see a bell icon in the navigation that shows when I have new notifications, so that I can quickly identify when there are important updates waiting for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has unread notifications THEN the system SHALL display a bell icon with a red badge showing the count of unread notifications
2. WHEN a user has no unread notifications THEN the system SHALL display a bell icon without any badge
3. WHEN a user clicks the bell icon THEN the system SHALL open a dropdown showing the most recent 5 notifications with options to view all or mark as read
4. WHEN a user hovers over the bell icon THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip indicating "Notifications"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a dedicated notifications page where I can view all my notifications in detail, so that I can review historical notifications and manage my notification preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the notifications page THEN the system SHALL display all notifications in reverse chronological order
2. WHEN a user views the notifications page THEN the system SHALL show notification details including title, message, timestamp, and read status
3. WHEN a user clicks on a notification THEN the system SHALL mark it as read and navigate to the relevant page if applicable
4. WHEN a user is on the notifications page THEN the system SHALL provide options to mark all as read or filter by notification type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to receive notifications about system events like user registrations, lead conversions, and system alerts, so that I can stay informed about important administrative activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a notification for all admin users
2. WHEN a lead is converted to a customer THEN the system SHALL create a notification for admin users
3. WHEN system cleanup operations complete THEN the system SHALL create a notification for admin users
4. WHEN a user is banned or unbanned THEN the system SHALL create a notification for admin users
5. IF a system error occurs THEN the system SHALL create a high-priority notification for admin users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer user, I want to receive notifications about my account activities and relevant updates, so that I can stay informed about changes affecting my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my account status changes THEN the system SHALL create a notification for me
2. WHEN my profile is updated by an admin THEN the system SHALL create a notification for me
3. WHEN there are system maintenance announcements THEN the system SHALL create a notification for all users
4. WHEN my lead status changes (if applicable) THEN the system SHALL create a notification for me

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want notifications to be delivered in real-time without requiring page refresh, so that I can receive timely updates while using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new notification is created for a user THEN the system SHALL deliver it in real-time using WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
2. WHEN a user receives a real-time notification THEN the bell icon badge SHALL update immediately
3. WHEN multiple users are online THEN the system SHALL deliver notifications to all relevant users simultaneously
4. IF the real-time connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to manage my notification preferences, so that I can control what types of notifications I receive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses notification settings THEN the system SHALL display toggles for different notification categories
2. WHEN a user disables a notification type THEN the system SHALL not create notifications of that type for the user
3. WHEN a user enables email notifications THEN the system SHALL send notifications to their registered email address
4. WHEN a user updates notification preferences THEN the system SHALL save the changes immediately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a flexible notification system that can be easily extended with new notification types, so that future features can integrate seamlessly with the notification system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new notification type THEN the system SHALL support it through a standardized interface
2. WHEN a notification is created THEN the system SHALL support custom data payloads for different notification types
3. WHEN displaying notifications THEN the system SHALL support custom rendering based on notification type
4. WHEN integrating with existing features THEN the system SHALL provide helper functions for common notification scenarios
