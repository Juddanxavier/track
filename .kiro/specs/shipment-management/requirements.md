# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The simplified shipment management system enables streamlined shipment tracking through admin-entered tracking numbers with third-party API integration. When an admin enters a tracking number, the system automatically fetches shipment details from third-party tracking APIs and saves them to the database. This approach eliminates complex user assignment workflows and signup features, focusing on efficient tracking number management and automated data retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to enter tracking numbers manually, so that I can create shipment records for packages I need to track.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin enters a tracking number THEN the system SHALL validate the tracking number format
2. WHEN a valid tracking number is entered THEN the system SHALL require courier/carrier selection
3. WHEN tracking number and carrier are provided THEN the system SHALL create a new shipment record
4. WHEN a shipment is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique internal tracking code automatically
5. IF a tracking number already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate entries and show appropriate error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system, I want to fetch shipment details from third-party APIs, so that shipment information is automatically populated without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tracking number is entered THEN the system SHALL call the appropriate third-party tracking API based on the selected carrier
2. WHEN API data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL populate shipment details including status, location, and delivery information
3. WHEN API data includes customer information THEN the system SHALL save customer name, address, and contact details
4. WHEN API call fails THEN the system SHALL create the shipment record with basic information and mark it for manual review
5. WHEN API returns tracking events THEN the system SHALL save all tracking history and status updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view all shipments in a management dashboard, so that I can monitor tracking status and manage shipments efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the shipments dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all shipments with current status
2. WHEN viewing shipments THEN the system SHALL show tracking number, carrier, status, customer info, and last update time
3. WHEN filtering shipments THEN the system SHALL provide filters for carrier, status, and date ranges
4. WHEN displaying shipments THEN the system SHALL highlight shipments needing attention (API failures, exceptions)
5. WHEN selecting a shipment THEN the system SHALL allow viewing detailed tracking history and manual status updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to track my shipment using the internal tracking code, so that I can see current status and delivery information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer visits the public tracking page THEN the system SHALL allow internal tracking code entry without authentication
2. WHEN a valid tracking code is entered THEN the system SHALL display current status, location updates, and estimated delivery
3. WHEN displaying tracking information THEN the system SHALL show a clean timeline of tracking events
4. WHEN tracking data is available THEN the system SHALL display carrier information and original tracking number
5. IF an invalid tracking code is entered THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system, I want to periodically sync tracking data, so that shipment information stays current with carrier updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shipment is active (not delivered) THEN the system SHALL periodically call the tracking API for updates
2. WHEN new tracking events are received THEN the system SHALL update the shipment status and add new events
3. WHEN a shipment is delivered THEN the system SHALL stop periodic syncing and mark as complete
4. WHEN API sync fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN sync frequency is configured THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and API quotas
