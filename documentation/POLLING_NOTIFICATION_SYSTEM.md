# Polling-Based Notification System

## Overview

Successfully switched from problematic SSE (Server-Sent Events) to a reliable polling-based notification system.

## What Changed

### Before (SSE Issues)
- Connections getting closed immediately (0s duration)
- Connection storms with multiple rapid reconnections
- "Client disconnect or connection closed" errors
- Unreliable real-time updates

### After (Polling Solution)
- ✅ Reliable 15-second polling intervals
- ✅ No connection storms
- ✅ Consistent notification updates
- ✅ Automatic fallback and recovery
- ✅ Works with all browsers and network conditions

## How It Works

1. **Polling Interval**: Fetches notifications every 15 seconds
2. **Parallel Requests**: Gets both recent notifications and unread count simultaneously
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates when marking notifications as read
4. **Visibility Handling**: Refreshes when tab becomes active
5. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry on failures

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/notifications/recent?limit=10` - Fetches recent notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Gets unread count
- `PATCH /api/notifications/{id}` - Mark notification as read
- `POST /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all as read

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: No connection management issues
2. **Simplicity**: Easier to debug and maintain
3. **Compatibility**: Works with all browsers and network setups
4. **Performance**: Lower server resource usage
5. **Predictability**: Consistent update intervals

## Configuration

The polling system is configured in `src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`:

```typescript
// Polling interval: 15 seconds
pollingIntervalRef.current = setInterval(() => {
    if (mountedRef.current && !document.hidden) {
        fetchNotifications(false);
    }
}, 15000);
```

## Switching Back to SSE

If you ever need to switch back to SSE (not recommended), use:

```bash
node scripts/switch-notification-system.js sse
```

## Testing

The notification system can be tested at `/test-sse` (now shows polling status instead of SSE).

## Performance Impact

- **Network**: 2 API calls every 15 seconds per active user
- **Server**: Minimal load compared to SSE connection management
- **Client**: Very low CPU usage, no memory leaks from connection management

## Conclusion

The polling-based approach provides a much more stable and reliable notification system compared to the previous SSE implementation. While it's not "real-time" (15-second delay), it's consistent and works reliably across all environments.
