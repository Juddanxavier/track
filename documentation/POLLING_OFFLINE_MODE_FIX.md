# Polling Offline Mode Fix

## Issue

The notification system was showing "⚪ Offline mode" instead of being connected, indicating that the polling system wasn't starting properly.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by **circular dependencies** in the React useCallback and useEffect hooks:

1. `startPolling` function had `isPolling` in its dependencies
2. `startPolling` sets `isPolling` to true when called
3. This recreated the `startPolling` function
4. The useEffect that calls `startPolling` would run again
5. This created conflicts that prevented polling from starting reliably

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Circular Dependencies

**Before:**
```typescript
const startPolling = useCallback(() => {
    if (!userId || isPolling || pollingIntervalRef.current) {
        return;
    }
    // ... polling logic
}, [userId, isPolling, fetchNotifications]); // ❌ isPolling caused circular dependency
```

**After:**
```typescript
const startPolling = useCallback(() => {
    if (!userId || pollingIntervalRef.current) { // ✅ Check interval ref instead
        return;
    }
    // ... polling logic
}, [userId, fetchNotifications]); // ✅ Removed isPolling dependency
```

### 2. Fixed useEffect Dependencies

**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    // ... initialization logic
}, [sessionLoading, userId, fetchNotifications, startPolling, stopPolling]); // ❌ Too many dependencies
```

**After:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    // ... initialization logic
}, [sessionLoading, userId]); // ✅ Only essential dependencies
```

### 3. Improved Visibility Change Handler

**Before:**
```typescript
if (!isPolling) {
    startPolling(); // ❌ Checking state that causes re-renders
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (!pollingIntervalRef.current) {
    startPolling(); // ✅ Check interval ref directly
}
```

### 4. Added Better Logging

Added comprehensive logging to help debug polling issues:
- Session loading status
- User ID presence
- Polling start/stop events
- Individual poll requests

## How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Browser Console
Look for these messages when the app loads:
```
🚀 Initializing notification polling system
✅ User found, starting notification system
📱 Initial notifications fetched, starting polling
✅ Starting notification polling
📡 Polling for notifications... (every 15 seconds)
```

### 2. Check Notification Bell Status
- Should show **🟢 Connected** instead of **⚪ Offline mode**
- Badge should update with unread count

### 3. Check Network Tab
- Should see API calls to `/api/notifications/recent` and `/api/notifications/unread-count` every 15 seconds

### 4. Run Test Script
```bash
node scripts/test-polling-system.js
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Immediate Connection**: Polling starts as soon as user session loads
2. **Reliable Updates**: Notifications refresh every 15 seconds
3. **Proper Status**: Bell shows "Connected" status
4. **Error Recovery**: Polling restarts when tab becomes active
5. **Clean Logging**: Clear console messages for debugging

## Testing

The fix has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ No circular dependency issues
- ✅ Polling starts reliably on page load
- ✅ Polling continues every 15 seconds
- ✅ Status shows as "Connected"
- ✅ Network requests are made consistently
- ✅ No memory leaks or duplicate intervals

The notification system should now work reliably with the polling approach instead of showing offline mode.
