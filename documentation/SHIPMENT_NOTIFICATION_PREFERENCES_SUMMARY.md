# Shipment Notification Preferences Implementation Summary

## Overview
Task 8.2 has been successfully implemented to update notification preferences for shipment events. The system now supports comprehensive shipment notification preferences for both admin and customer users.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Notification Types Added
The following shipment notification types are now supported:

**Admin Notifications:**
- `SHIPMENT_CREATED` - When new shipments are created
- `SHIPMENT_EXCEPTION` - When shipments encounter delivery exceptions
- `SHIPMENT_DELAYED` - When shipments are delayed beyond expected delivery
- `SHIPMENT_DELIVERY_FAILED` - When shipment delivery attempts fail

**Customer Notifications:**
- `SHIPMENT_STATUS_UPDATED` - General status updates for shipments
- `SHIPMENT_DELIVERED` - When shipments are successfully delivered
- `SHIPMENT_OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` - When shipments are out for delivery
- `SHIPMENT_IN_TRANSIT` - When shipments are in transit

### 2. UI Components Updated
- **NotificationPreferences.tsx**: Updated to include shipment notification categories
  - Added "Shipments (Admin)" category for admin users
  - Added "Shipments (Customer)" category for customer users
  - Each notification type includes both in-app and email notification options

### 3. Backend Support
- **Notification Templates**: All shipment notification types have predefined templates with dynamic data injection
- **Default Preferences**: New users automatically get default preferences for shipment notifications based on their role
- **Event Handlers**: Complete event handlers for all shipment notification scenarios

### 4. Database Schema
The existing notification preferences table already supports the shipment notification types:
- `type` field stores the notification type
- `enabled` field controls in-app notifications
- `emailEnabled` field controls email notifications

## User Experience

### For Admin Users
Admins can now configure preferences for:
- Notifications when new shipments are created
- Alerts for shipment exceptions and delivery failures
- Updates on shipment delays
- Both in-app and email notification options

### For Customer Users
Customers can now configure preferences for:
- Status updates on their shipments
- Delivery notifications
- Out-for-delivery alerts
- In-transit updates
- Both in-app and email notification options

## API Endpoints
The existing notification preferences API endpoints support shipment notifications:
- `GET /api/notifications/preferences` - Retrieve user preferences (includes shipment types)
- `PUT /api/notifications/preferences` - Update user preferences (supports shipment types)
- `GET /api/notifications/preferences/[type]` - Get specific preference type
- `PUT /api/notifications/preferences/[type]` - Update specific preference type

## Integration with Shipment System
The notification preferences integrate seamlessly with the existing shipment management system:
- Shipment event handlers check user preferences before sending notifications
- Users can opt-out of specific shipment notification types
- Email notifications respect user preferences
- In-app notifications respect user preferences

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `src/components/notifications/NotificationPreferences.tsx` - Added shipment notification UI
2. Fixed TypeScript issues in route files for Next.js 15 compatibility

### Files Already Supporting Shipment Notifications
1. `src/types/notification.ts` - Shipment notification types defined
2. `src/lib/notificationTemplateManager.ts` - Shipment templates included
3. `src/lib/notificationEventHandlers.ts` - Shipment event handlers implemented
4. `src/lib/notificationService.ts` - Default preferences include shipment types

## Testing
The system has been verified to:
- ✅ Build successfully without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Include all shipment notification types in the UI
- ✅ Support both admin and customer notification categories
- ✅ Provide both in-app and email notification options
- ✅ Integrate with existing notification infrastructure

## Requirements Fulfilled
All requirements from task 8.2 have been met:
- ✅ Add shipment notification types to user preferences
- ✅ Allow customers to opt-in/out of shipment notifications  
- ✅ Include email and in-app notification options
- ✅ Requirements: 4.4 (notification integration with shipment events)

## Next Steps
The shipment notification preferences are now fully functional. Users can:
1. Access notification preferences via the dashboard
2. Configure shipment notification settings
3. Choose between in-app and email notifications
4. Receive notifications based on their preferences when shipment events occur

The implementation is complete and ready for production use.
